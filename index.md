### Basics on long-read sequencing QC (Nanopore and PacBio)

## Welcome! 
This page cotains a tutorial for basic QC .The material was initially created for the Computational Sessions of the [2022 JAX Long Read Sequencing Workshop ](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2022/may/long-read-sequencing-workshop) but I will try to keep it updated with new methods.



------------------
## FORMAT
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gabyrech/gabyrech.githhub.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gabyrech/gabyrech.githhub.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
